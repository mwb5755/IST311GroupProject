# IST311GroupProject

 Design an application that teaches grade school children
arithmetic. Your application should randomly create various arithmetic
problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and present to
the user. It then needs to get the answers from the user and verify it.
Create different levels of difficulty. For example, level 1 could be simple
problems, level 2 a bit harder, level 3 for complex problems so on and so
forth.

We will have 4 Classes and a Class that runs the application
